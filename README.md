**BETA VERSION**  

_FullTextSearch_ is the core App of a full-text search framework for your Nextcloud. 
To have it operate, and get content indexed, some other Apps are needed: 

- Some **Providers Apps** to extract content from your Nextcloud. 
- A **Platform App** that communicate with a search platform _(ie. Elastic Search, Solr, ...)_ in order to index the content provided by the **Providers**.   
_Note: There is no limit to the number of Platform-App to be installed, however only one can be selected from the Admin Interface_
